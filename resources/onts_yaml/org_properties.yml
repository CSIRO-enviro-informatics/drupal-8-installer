  description: "Gives an identifier, such as a company registration number, that can be used to used to uniquely identify the organization. Many different national and international identier schemes are available. The org ontology is neutral to which schemes are used. The particular identifier scheme should be indicated by the datatype of the identifier value.Using datatypes to distinguish the notation scheme used is consistent with recommended best practice for `skos:notation` of which this property is a specialization."

http://www.w3.org/ns/org#linkedTo: 
  label: "linked to"
  description: "Indicates an arbitrary relationship between two organizations. Specializations of this can be used to, for example, denote funding or supply chain relationships."

  label: "member of"
  description: "Indicates that a person is a member of the Organization with no indication of the nature of that membership or the role played.

http://www.w3.org/ns/org#purpose: 
  label: "purpose"
  description: "Indicates the purpose of this Organization. There can be many purposes at different levels of abstraction but the nature of an organization is to have a reason for existence and this property is a means to document that reason. An Organization may have multiple purposes. It is recommended that the purpose be denoted by a controlled term or code list, ideally a `skos:Concept`. However, the range is left open to allow for other types of descriptive schemes. It is expected that specializations or application profiles of this vocabulary will constrain the range of the purpose. Alternative names: _remit_ _responsibility_ (esp. if applied to OrganizationalUnits such as Government Departments)."

http://www.w3.org/ns/org#remuneration: 
  label: "remuneration"

The intended semantics is a Membership relation involving the Role implies the existence of a direct property relationship through an inference rule of the form:`{ [] org:member ?p; org:organization ?o; org:role [org:roleProperty ?r] } -> {?p ?r ?o}`."

http://www.w3.org/ns/org#siteAddress: 
  label: "site Address"

  label: "unit Of"
